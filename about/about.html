        <p>Graciella Velasco, now 23 years old, was born in Ilocos Norte, Philippines, 
            and soon moved to Turlock, California at the age of 1 and a half years old. 
            She moved around a lot as a kid, living with numerous family members at a time, 
            but eventually finding a home in Lathrop, California with her parents and 3 younger 
            siblings. Out of the four siblings, she is the oldest and will be the first child to
             graduate from college. <br>
            <br>
             She is currently a full time student that currently goes to San Francisco State University. 
             She had originally went to Sacramento State to pursue a degree in Psychology. She changed 
             her mind mid college-career and decided to pursue design instead, which lead her to
             finding her passion again in San Francisco. Graciella is now finishing up her last year 
             at SF State and plans on getting a career in the UX/UI design field.<br>

        <h1>PHILOSOPHY</h1>
        <p>Design is more than aesthetics; it's a medium for creating meaningful and impactful experiences. 
            Her design philosophy is rooted in the belief that every design should be purposeful, user-centered, 
            and empathetic. It should have a purpose-driven design that has a clear goal within every element, color 
            and interaction. Her designs come with a user-centered approach that also has elegant simplicity.
